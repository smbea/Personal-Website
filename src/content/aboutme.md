Hey there! My name is Beatriz and I’m a software engineer currently based in Porto, Portugal. I’m on the last year of my Informatics and Computing Engineering Master’s degree.

My main interests are mobile and web development but my enthusiasm for technology also manifests itself through UX/UI design. I care about developing a functional yet beautiful product.

Some of my hobbies include singing, travelling, experimenting with makeup, taking and editing photos. I like hanging out in coffee shops and snuggling with my cat.
